## Description

A ToDo application developed through TDD using Junit framework

## Purpose 

I'm using this project to get reacquainted with Java and to learn the Junit framework while also getting some practice in TDD.

## Todo list for my Todo application

#### * Add a switch function to handle the functionality direction.

#### * Add a sorting algorithm that takes a parameter to determine how to sort.

#### * Add interface in form of String output and feedback for the user.

#### * Add ability for the user to input data and create todolists.

#### * Create a container for multiple todolists?
